#  Bitcoin Ticker

## Our Goal

The objective of this challenge is to apply the skills you learned in the Clima tutorial and make a Bitcoin price reporter. We are going to revisit how to use Cocoapods, networking calls and JSON parsing. This will be the most advanced challenge you will face to date. We believe in you!
